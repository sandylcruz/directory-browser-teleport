# üîé Directory Browser

Directory Browser allows a user to browse directory content on a remote server.
It's built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## ‚öíÔ∏è Development

### Running the Servers

```sh
yarn start
```

### Running the Tests

```sh
yarn test
```

### Running a Type Check

```sh
yarn tsc
```

### Making Commits

[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is used to ensure that all commits follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern.

```sh
yarn commit
```

Status check exists to ensure that all commits abide by this pattern.
